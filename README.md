GeoEstateChat is a research project exploring how LLMs can enhance the interaction between geospatial analysis and real-estate decision-making. The project studies LLMs as analytical intermediaries that translate natural-language questions into structured, multi-scale geospatial queries, rather than as sources of knowledge.
